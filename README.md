# Investigate the TMDb movie dataset

The TMDb Movie dataset, one of Udacity's curated datasets has been selected for investigation using NumPy and Pandas. The dataset is a collection of information on around 10000 movies. For each movie, the dataset includes information on aspects such as popularity, budget, revenue, cast, directors, production house, date of release, runtime, and its rating. 

* The data was assessed and necessary cleaning steps (documented with reasoning in the Jupyter notebook) were performed to unify formats, deal with missing data and prepare the dataset for analysis
* The data was explored to gather insights into correlations between different aspects, visualizations were created and inferences were made to answer the research questions documented below: 

## RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. How have movie production trends varied over the years?
2a. What are the top 20 highest grossing movies? 
2b. What are the top 20 most expensive movies? 
3. How do budgets correlate with revenues? Do higher budget movies have higher revenue?

7. What run times are associated with each genre?
8. Who are the top 20 directors who made highly rated films? The directors considered for  should have made atleast 5 movies in    the time period 1960 - 2015 represented in the dataset.
